Problems I've driven myself insane over and would like to solve one day

Seesaw - https://open.kattis.com/problems/seesaw?tab=metadata 
Difficulty: 8.5
- Works for many, many test cases. Exceeding time limit
- Creating a new object for every person and constant updates to that list
- Updating neighbors as groups merge is difficult

Parking Lot - https://open.kattis.com/contests/gd2v8k/problems/parkinglot?tab=metadata
Difficulty: 8.1
- Attempted to reconstruct a graph based on searching through candidate nodes then run Dijkstra's on that represenatative graph
- Almost certain this uses a supercover version of Bresenham's line algo
- Might need to make a frontier using BFS?
